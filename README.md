Password Deaddrop
=================

Inspired by [temporary.pw](https://temporary.pw), this is a single-server
version.

This service generates a random password each time upon visit.  The password
can be used for your own purposes.  You can share the password with friends via
a link.

The link is valid for exactly once. If your friends can get the password via
link, then they get it, and no one else would do after that. If not, then
the password is leaked, but you can always try with your friends again.
